Project Overview
In the financial industry, approving or denying loans is a critical task that requires evaluating various factors such as income, credit score, employment history, and more. This project uses a linear regression model to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on these factors.

The dataset used for this project contains historical loan data, including both approved and denied applications. We use this data to train the machine learning model, which can then make predictions on new loan applications.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python (>=3.6) installed
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
Required libraries and dependencies installed (specified in the project's requirements.txt file)
